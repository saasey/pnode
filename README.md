Here is the beginning of your best PHP routing and balancing system. Please, allow yourself to get comfy.

PHP Experts: Founder Packs are now being taken up in order to supplement the beginning phases of media and other relevant sources of advertising. The Packs are $25. Your task is to lower the complexity and make it faster than it is. Also, documentation and new modules are welcome.

Founder Pack benefits: Free access to this PHP Package and financial support on sales starting at $20 of consumer sales for those who took the fore first. There will be 3 rounds. First round is 'complexity'. Second round ($15/sale) new modules, and the third round of complexity, documentation, and anything else in modules that would need to be added ($10/sale).

All code will need to be examined.

I will take up to 15 programmers in total. If you want, you can buy in on further packs. The more interest you get into this, the more you will be giving back to the group as a whole. Thank you.

The code will be open source until it is released as commercial software. The money will give us advertising and tax funds. This is based in Owosso, Michigan 48867, USA.

This Announcement will be here until the third round is over, or I have 15 programmers. Early bird gets the worm.
